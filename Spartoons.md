# Smart screen

## Summary

I would like to make a smarth screen for my room, to have the calendar, the agenda, see the clock and the weather and to appear some interesting news. I always find attractive the idea to have all of this when I wake up in the morning. So my project would be that one, create for me my screen to see every day in the morning all this things. I don’t have a smarth screen, so my plan is to use a DAKboard CPU v3 (Orange Pi 3 LTS), a web server and a monitor to create my own. I have already a big screen from an old computer I disassembled, so if you know a cheaper alternative to the DAKboard I could buy a pair, because at now I’m living in two places at the same time, so it would be perfect for my to have a smartScreen in every place. With all of this I would create a program to connect this with my Notion to show the calendar, the clock, the weather, some interesting news, the emails received (and maybe something more I’m not thinking about it now).

## Plan

Create subjections that allow me to keep all of the tech parts together.
Assemble the device and plug all of the tech in.
Design a web interface that connects to the Notion to show the calendar, the clock, the weather, some interesting news, the emails received (and maybe something more I’m not thinking about it now)..
Run the web interface on the local device and that's all!
