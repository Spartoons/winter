# Smart screen

## Summary

I would like to make a smarth screen for my room, to have the calendar, the agenda, see the clock and the weather and to appear some interesting news. I always find attractive the idea to have all of this when I wake up in the morning. So my project would be that one, create for me my screen to see every day in the morning all this things. I don’t have a smarth screen, so my plan is to use a couple of Pine 64, a web server and a couple of monitors to create my own. At now I’m living in two places at the same time, so it would be perfect for my to have a smartScreen in every place, I have already a big screen from an old computer I disassembled, so for this onwe I will only need the controller. With all of this I would create a program to connect this with my Notion to show the calendar, the clock, the weather, some interesting news, the emails received, it can even tell what clothes weare from my closet deppending of the wheater (and maybe something more I’m not thinking about it now).

## Plan

1. Create subjections that allow me to keep all of the tech parts together.
2. Dissasemble the monitor.
3. Assemble the device and plug all of the tech in, on the wall.
4. Design a web interface that connects to the Notion to show the calendar, the clock, the weather, some interesting news, the emails received (and maybe something more I’m not thinking about it now).
5. Run the web interface on the local device and that's all!
